 *    ## Notetag Info
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # Actor/Class/Weapon/Armor/Enemy/State Notetags:
 *      State notetags take the highest priority, followed by enemy, weapon,
 *      armor, class and actor
 *      1. <operator max patb val: val>
 *         - Assigns val to the battler's maximum atb value via operator
 *         - operator can be either =, +, -, *, / or %, meaning set to, add
 *           by, subtract by, multiply by, divide by or modulo by respectively
 *         - All instances of this notetag will be used sequentially
 *         - The final max atb_value must be at least 10000 times larger than
 *           2 ^ -52
 *      2. <patb colors: text color 1, text color 2>
 *         - Changes the atb bar color 1 and 2 to text color 1 and 2
 *           respectively when this notetag's used
 *         - The 1st notetag that's being read by the battler will be used
 *      3. <patb overlay colors: text color 1, text color 2>
 *         - Changes the atb overlay color 1 and 2 to text color 1 and 2
 *           respectively when this notetag's used
 *         - The 1st notetag that's being read by the battler will be used

 *       You need not edit this part as it's about how this plugin works
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # Plugin Support Info:
 *      1. Prerequisites
 *         - Basic knowledge of this plugin on the user level, the default
 *           battle system implementations and the atb system concepts
 *         - Some Javascript coding proficiency to fully comprehend this
 *           plugin
 *      2. Function documentation
 *         - The 1st part describes why this function's rewritten/extended for
 *           rewritten/extended functions or what the function does for new
 *           functions
 *         - The 2nd part describes what the arguments of the function are
 *         - The 3rd part informs which version rewritten, extended or created
 *           this function
 *         - The 4th part informs whether the function's rewritten or new
 *         - The 5th part informs whether the function's a real or potential
 *           hotspot
 *         - The 6th part describes how this function works for new functions
 *           only, and describes the parts added, removed or rewritten for
 *           rewritten or extended functions only
 *         Example:
 * /*----------------------------------------------------------------------
